## Creative Portion
1) can tag an event's priority (high, medium, low, or none)
2) can share an event with user - this is available after a user creates an event and can access it through the "Event Details" dialog window. The event will show in the  calendar of the user who it was shared with as an uneditable event.
3) can toggle between default and dark theme with toggle slider at top
4) can jump to a certain month/year in the calendar
